### Object detection library I wrote for my Master's.

Currently library has implements:
  - Fast R-CNN; includes an ROI pooling layer for lasagne, as well as a Theano Op.
  - YOLO version 1 and 2; version 1 doesn't work particularly well, but version 2 is functional.
  - SSD
  
While also having:
  - A module for storing training sessions in a SQL database.
  - A module for Bayesian optimization.
 
Also have some documentation, although the library is still under development and a few things need to be modified/added.

If you'd like to see the documentation and would rather not compile it yourself (I'm serving the compiled documentation on a server hosted on one of my computers), or have any other questions regarding the code contact me at colingaudreau@gmail.com.
